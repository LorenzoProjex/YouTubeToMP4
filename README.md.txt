YouTubeToMP4 by LorenzoProjex

Welcome to the README.md file. 

My name is Tom Lorenzo and this is my first Python project. 

We all start from somewhere, so please don't expect this to be a revolutionary product any time soon. 

However, as my Python skills advance, I'll be bringing some cool updates to the application to showcase what I've learnt which hopefully allows for a great experience for you.


What is YouTubeToMP4?

YouTubeToMP4 is a very simple application that allows you to download any video from the YouTube website onto your computer. It's been built using Python with CustomTkinter & PyTube.
